    <div> <b> LIONS <br/> Lion, often referred to as the "king of the jungle," is a majestic and powerful big cat found in various habitats across Africa and Asia. Known for its muscular build, distinctive mane (in males), and a roar that can be heard from several miles away, lions are apex predators within their ecosystems. They live in social groups called prides, consisting of related females and their offspring, led by one or more dominant males. Lions are primarily carnivorous, preying on a variety of animals such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo. They are known for their teamwork when hunting, utilizing coordinated strategies to bring down large prey. Despite their fearsome reputation, lions spend much of their time resting and conserving energy, with bursts of intense activity during hunting and defending their territory. In many cultures, lions symbolize strength, courage, and royalty, often depicted in heraldry, art, literature, and mythology. Their conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable, facing threats such as habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. Efforts are underway to protect and conserve lion populations to ensure their survival in the wild.</b></div>
